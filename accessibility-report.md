# Accessibility Report

## 1. Equitable Use
At the moment our application only helps able-bodied users.
Meaning it lacks the extra funtionality that may be required
for people such as the blind or those with mobility issues.
We could in the future add a noise to alert a user when
the timer is up or add functionality for a screen reader.

## 2. Flexibility in Use
Our application has large on screen buttons that easily
allows anyone to read and recognize what each button does.
In addition, the functions within the app can be used
together or a user may use one function of the app if they
wish, and it will still operate well.

## 3. Simple and Intuitive Use
The application is very simple to use and messages that
help a user know if something is wrong. Such as a message
to notify the user that only positive numbers are accepted
when creating a task. At the moment we don't offer any other
language support but that could be added in the future

## 4. Perceptible Information
It is easy to perceive the information in the app through
the large buttons with icons on the home page, the large
size of the timer or the progress bar that is in the task
menu. There still could be more such as the previously
mentioned noise for when a timer is up.

## 5. Tolerance for Error
Our application has been tested to reduce error. Such
that crashes will not happen, for example when an invalid
number has been entered for input for task creation.
Instead, a message will appear to tell you what is wrong with
input.

## 6. Low Physical Effort
Our application is very simple and it easily allows a user 
to manoeuvre throughout it. More work could be done in
the future though, such as mobile support.

## 7. Size and Space for Approach and Use
The font size is easily legible and size of our buttons
are large enough such that any user can easily identify
and take the actions they wish within the application.

## 8. Our Target Audience
The users we most want to market our program towards
would be students. Primarily those with difficulty 
focusing on one task (i.e. those with ADD or ADHD).
The task creation would help these users find one task
that they wish to complete and really focus and devote
themselves to it for the duration they set. In addition,
the timer can be used for the pomodoro technique of 
studying to study for a set portion of time and then a 
break for a portion of time. The focus timer then can be
used to show the user how long they were focused or a
history of tasks completed.

## 9. Demographic of our Users
As stated early our user demographic will mostly consist
of students and younger individuals. While older users may
still use it for its task setting functions, they may not
get the same value from it that others might. In addition,
we may not see as much use from students who study from
notebooks(such as elementary or even high school students).
In return, we will see higher use from those studying or
working from or by their laptops/computers (such as
computer science students or working professionals).  
Note that we do not intend to alienate any of these users,
we simply believe these are the users who will gain the 
most out of the use of our application.
