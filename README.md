## Project Blueprint DEMO

Domain: Focus & Flow; Timed Task Setter
Software Specification:
This program enables users to create and manage timed tasks effectively.
Users can define specific tasks along with the time they estimate is needed to complete each one.
The software tracks these timers and tasks, allowing users to monitor their progress.
The user can pause a task if they need to.
If a user decides to pause or cancel a task, it will be marked as unsuccessful.
An unsuccessful task can either be restarted or deleted.
Conversely, successfully completed tasks will be labeled as successful and recorded in the user’s profile,
which maintains a comprehensive history of both completed and uncompleted (paused and cancelled) tasks.
Users will also have the ability to view their completed and uncompleted tasks,
allowing them to correct any errors if necessary.

User Stories:
1. Lia needs to manage her time effectively for her group project. She starts the Flow & Focus software and sets a timer labeled ‘Group Project Work’ for an hour and a half. [team story]
2. Lia is in the middle of her “Reading Time” timer when she receives a phone call. She pauses her timer to take the call and resumes her reading afterward.
3. Lia realizes she needs to review her productivity. She opens the Flow & Focus software to access her task history, where she can view both completed and uncompleted tasks.
4. Lia needs to correct an error in her task history. She reviews her completed tasks and edits one that was incorrectly labeled, ensuring her records are accurate. [team story]
